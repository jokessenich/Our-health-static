# OurHealth App!

This is a web app that allows users to share alternative remedies with one another.

## Motivation

I built this app as a central hub and reliable storage place for online home remedies. Often I have to go searching on blogs, or ask through family what are the best remedies. Now home remedies can be shared from one spot!
